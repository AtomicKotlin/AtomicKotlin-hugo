## Initiating a Translation

Contract should include agreements for:
- Print Book
- Ebook
- Translation of AtomicKotlin EDU exercises and solutions


## Advance

The advance represents your expectations and commitment to the book. A low
advance indicates you don't think the book will do that well in your country,
and that you think it's too risky to commit to a high advance.

Although some publishers will want to connect a higher advance to lower
royalties, that style of negotiation does not appeal to me.

## Royalties

Different countries calculate royalties differently. Please be clear on whether
your royalty percentage represents the wholesale or retail price of the book.
