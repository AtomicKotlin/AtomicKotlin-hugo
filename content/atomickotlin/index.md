***Atomic Kotlin*** is the book and associated learning resources by Bruce
Eckel and Svetlana Isakova.

December 9, 2020: The eBook is finished and published on
[Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/AtomicKotlin). The print book is available
starting January 11, 2020.

- We *thought* the book was done before but ended up going over and over it, and
  adding material for Kotlin 1.4. We found lots of things to improve. It's
  really done now, and this is the version that is in print. Thanks for your
  patience and we hope you enjoy the book!
