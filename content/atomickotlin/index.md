***Atomic Kotlin*** is the book and associated learning resources by Bruce
Eckel and Svetlana Isakova.

December 9, 2020: The eBook is finished and published on
[Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/AtomicKotlin). The Stepik version will be
available soon, and we hope to get the the print book should appear within the
next couple of months.

- We *thought* the book was done before but ended up going over and over the
  material, and adding material for Kotlin 1.4 and found lots of things to
  improve. It's really done now, and this is the version that will go into
  print. Thanks for your patience and we hope you enjoy the book!
