The first and experimental Atomic Kotlin Seminar will be held in Crested Butte,
Colorado, August 20-24, 2018. The seminar will follow the atoms and exercises
in the *Atomic Kotlin* book, and will be taught by the book's authors, Bruce
Eckel and Svetlana Isakova.

The book's chapters are very short---we call them "atoms" because we try to
make them so small as to be indivisible. Accordingly, the lectures will also be
short.

The primary reasons we are calling this an "experimental" seminar are:

1. We are trying out the material in a classroom situation for the first
time, and we will be using some experimental techniques during the exercise
periods.

2. We invite both programming novices (that is, some programming experience but
relatively minimal) and experienced programmers to the seminar, with the idea
that working together during the exercise periods will have benefits to both.

3. We are also experimenting with the schedule, attempting to reduce the impact
of [Diminishing Returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns)
with a schedule of between 5-6 hours/day. Also, the weather in Crested Butte
in August can follow a monsoon pattern, and if so we'll concentrate those hours
in the afternoon (when it often rains). We'll meet at 9:00 on the first day
and sort this out.

Because this is a first-time experimental seminar, the price is $750 if your
company is sending you and $250 for individuals.

Note that the [Software Architecture Forum](http://softwarearchitectureforum.com/)
takes place the week directly after the seminar, in case you'd like to spend a
second week in Crested Butte immersed in fun technical explorations.
