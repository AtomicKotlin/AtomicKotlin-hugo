## Initiating a Translation

Contract should include translation agreements for:
- Print Book
- Ebook
- Translation of AtomicKotlin EDU exercises and solutions

When there are competing publishers, I will relay the current offer to all
publishers, including both the advance and the royalties. The decision will
be made based on the combination of the two, but with a strong weight towards
the advance.

## Advance

The advance represents your expectations of the book's sales. A low advance
indicates you don't think the book will do that well in your country.

The advance also represents your commitment to promoting and selling the book.
A low advance indicates that you are not willing to take that risk.

Some publishers want to connect a higher advance to lower royalties. I do not
consider the two to be connected.

Please understand that my goal in negotiating a high advance is the ability it
gives me to finance future projects. Also it's much simpler for me to focus
on advances.

## Royalties

Different countries calculate royalties differently. Please be clear on whether
your royalty percentage represents the wholesale or retail price of the book.
Put another way, does the royalty represent a percentage of the cover price
(retail) or is it a percentage of the price paid to the publisher by the
distributor or bookseller (wholesale)?

## Translation Sources

AtomicKotlin EDU

## Requesting Printed "Working Copies"

The print copies are not the most up-to-date "source of truth" for this book,
but rather the Leanpub version is -- that is the one I can easily update and
should be used for reference (I additionally give read access to the Github
repository where the markdown version of the book is stored, for publishers who
want it). So I would rather only give the Leanpub and/or Github version for them
to work from (also it is expensive, and a hassle for me, to print and send 3
copies to another country). If you really want a print copy of the book, please
get it directly through Ingram, which distributes worldwide.
