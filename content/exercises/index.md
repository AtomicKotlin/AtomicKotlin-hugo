Each atom in *Atomic Kotlin* is accompanied by several exercises. These
exercises improve your understanding, so we recommend solving them right after
reading the atom. All exercises can be checked automatically within IntelliJ
IDEA, and you can see your progress while solving them.

To solve the exercises, install IntelliJ IDEA with the EduTools plugin by
following these tutorials:

1. [Install IntelliJ IDEA and the EduTools
Plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/install-edutools-plugin.html).

2. [Open the Atomic Kotlin course and solve the
exercises](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/learner-start-guide.html?section=Atomic%20Kotlin).

In the EduTools course, you'll find solutions for all exercises. If you're
stuck on a task, you can check the hints or peek at the solution---if you do
this, we still recommend implementing it yourself.
