Each atom in *Atomic Kotlin* is accompanied by 2 to 5 small exercises. These
exercises improve your understanding, so we recommend solving them right after
reading the atom. All exercises are checked automatically, and you can see your
progress while solving them.

To solve the exercises, install IntelliJ IDEA with the Edu Tools plugin by
following these tutorials:
1. [Installing IntelliJ IDEA and EduTools
Plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/install-edutools-plugin.html).
2. [Opening the Atomic Kotlin course and solving the
exercises](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/learner-start-guide.html?section=Atomic%20Kotlin).

In the course, you'll find solutions for all exercises. If you're stuck on a
task, feel free to peek at the solution, but we still recommend implementing it
yourself.
