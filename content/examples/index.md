All the examples in Atomic Kotlin are available from this repository:

> [Atomic Kotlin Examples](https://github.com/BruceEckel/AtomicKotlinExamples)

You can compile, run, and test the examples using standalone tools on the
command line. The README for that repository contains complete instructions for
configuring and running the code.

The examples in the repository are created using an automatic process that
extracts the examples directly from the book. The repository includes a test of
the code exactly as it appears in the book, to verify that it is correct.
